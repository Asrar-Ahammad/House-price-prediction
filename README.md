# House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting house prices based on various features. The project implements a regression model to estimate the prices of houses using a dataset of real estate information.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `programs/`: This directory contains the notebook of training machine learning model, The templates directory which contains web page files which are built using HTML,CSS,JS. The `.pkl` file that has trained model. The clean data.
- `requirements.txt`: This file contains all the packages that are used in this project.
## Getting Started

To get started with this project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Asrar-Ahammad/House-price-prediction.git

2. Set up the Python environment with the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

`cd House-price-prediction`
`python -m venv env`
`source env/bin/activate`  # For Unix/Linux
`env\Scripts\activate`  # For Windows
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the `programs/house_price_prediction.ipynb` sequentially to execute the code and reproduce the results.
